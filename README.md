[My Notes](notes.md)




> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch
An application that allows students to create study/project groups _quickly_ and _easily_. __Only__ the host of a "group" will need to have an account to use this platform. After a group/room is created a code can be shared that allows other students to join __without creating an account__, this design choice reduces the friction there is in starting a project. 

### Design

### Key features

- Ability to Sign in/ Sign up
    - Ability, when signed in to create groups
    - Ability to keep groups saved between sessions
- Group rooms that can be joined/ accessed to communicate with classmates
    - Ability to join rooms _without_ an account using an access code

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - To render chat rooms, login page, and other pages/sections that will allow the user to navigate the app
- **CSS** - To make buttons more interactive and improve the look of the pages.
- **React** - To allow me to make the website more reactive to user inputs and allow for webhooks
- **Service** - Authentication endpoints, chat services, 3rd party image calls to give each group a unique image without having to store images
- **DB/Login** - Stores log ins, and chat histories and who is connected to each room
- **WebSocket** - Allows for real time communication in the chat rooms
